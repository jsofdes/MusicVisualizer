# MusicVisualizer
Visualizing Music w/ Python
==============
Proposal by: Christina Gee and Juanita Desouza

**Project Proposal:**
For our project we would like to create an interactive music visualizer.
In this visualizer, we would like to vary the color, size and shapes of the visualization
according to the beat and other characteristics (eg: volume) of the music.

The user can interact with this visualization by clicking on the screen and
having the same/similar object in the area the user clicked on.

This is our MVP proposal, if we have additional time we would like experiment with
splitting bodies or adding two bodies to the screen.

**Learning Goals:**
-Learn more about git (JD)
-Utlizing py.game (JD + CG)
-Practicing installing packages and debugging (CG)
-Have a completed MVP product that is functional vs. a complicated and unfinished product (CG + JD)

**Libraries:**
-pyo
-pygame
-pysynth
-pyaudio
- + More that we plan on researching

**By Next Week's Mid Check-In:**
-Packages installed
-Libraries determined
-Classes and objects determined
-Pseudo coding
-Dividing work

**Risks:**
-Time
-Complexity of project
